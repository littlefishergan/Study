### Point Estimation

Using the estimation of $\pi$ to show the meaning of point estimation:  

$$
\begin{matrix}S_{circle} = \pi r^2\\S_{square} = 4r^2\end{matrix} \implies \pi = 4 \frac{S_{circle}}{S_{square}}
$$


The we get:
$$
\hat{\pi} = 4 \frac{m}{n}
$$
Where m and n represents the number of samples in corresponding areas:

### Confidence Interval

In contrast to point estimators, confidence intervals estimate a parameter by **specifying a range of possible values**. Such an interval is associated with a **confidence level**, which is the **probability** that the procedure used to generate the interval will produce an interval **containing the true parameter**.
