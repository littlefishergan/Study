# Study

This repository is used to share some ideas related to how I study and some subjects that I am currently studying right now.  

I am beginning to write knowledge using Markdown so this attempt serves first as a self-learning method. And I hope some interesting ideas will arise during the continuous work I put into this form of studying. 

(It is really useful to upload some pictures to repository and use corresponding url links in my Markdown notes!)
